# Customer-Personality-Analysis--Preprocessing-dataset-using-python
## Projet objective
This project focuses on preparing customer data for further analysis by applying essential preprocessing steps using Python. The dataset includes demographic and behavioral information about customers, and the preprocessing ensures the data is clean, consistent, and analysis-ready.

## Datast Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Shifanaks/Customer-Personality-Analysis-Preprocessing--python/blob/main/Customer%20Personality%20Analysis.csv">Dataset</a>

## What I Have Done in This Project:
 1. Checked Data Types: Verified each column's data type to ensure it matches the nature of the data (e.g., numerical, categorical, date).
 2. Explored Dataset Statistics: Used .describe() and other summary statistics to understand the data distribution and detect anomalies.
 3. Identified Missing Values: Detected null or missing entries in the dataset.
 4. Handled Missing Values: Filled missing values using the median, which is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean.
 5. Checked for Duplicates: Ensured no duplicate records exist in the dataset to maintain integrity.
 6. Explored Unique Values: Reviewed unique entries in categorical columns to understand feature diversity and prepare for encoding.
